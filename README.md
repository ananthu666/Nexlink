Link prediction in social networks, driven by vast data generated through interactions, offers invaluable benefits such as enhanced audience understanding, effective customer segmentation, and the design of Recommendation Systems. Additionally, it serves as a powerful tool to combat misinformation, specifically detecting fake news. In practical applications, link prediction facilitates predicting customer-product connections in online marketplaces, fosters collaborations among employees, and uncovers crucial insights within complex networks, including those associated with security concerns like terrorist networks. Utilizing structured datasets and machine learning techniques, link prediction enables the anticipation of connections between unlinked nodes, providing actionable insights for decision-making.
